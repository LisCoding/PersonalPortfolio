<div class="story">
  <p>I am a self-taught Software Engineer, who fell in love with coding the moment I solved my first algorithm.
    Iâ€™m a tech knowledge seeker, and I learned 3 full technology stacks within 3 months. I come from a non traditional coding background and I have a diverse background. I studied Chemical Engineering, marketing, business, and accounting in order to find my true passion, and I'm happy I finally discovered it "Coding"!
